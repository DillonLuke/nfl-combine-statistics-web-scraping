# NFL Combine Statistics Web Scraping
The purpose of this project is to provide functions and a notebook for scraping statistics for players participating in the NFL combine across a user-specified range of years. All data is scraped from pro-football-reference.com, using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

Statistics include combine metrics for players participating in the combine as well as their associated college football statistics. Combine metrics include height/weight, 40-yard dash, vertical jump, bench press reps, broad jump, 3-cone drill, 20-yard shuttle, and draft result. College football statistics include passing, rushing, receiving, and defensive statistics.
